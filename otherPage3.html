    <p>I couldn't agree more about LaurelÂ Schwulst's reasons for advocating for personal websites. Personal websites
      have a much higher degree of freedom than social networking software, allowing individuals to create the website
      they want, exactly the way they want it to be.
      At the same time, this high degree of freedom also means that individuals can use their own creativity and ideas
      on their own personal websites, which is an advantage of personal websites.
      Also, personal websites have a longer lifespan compared to social software. Publishing on social software is often
      limited by the software's algorithms and so on, resulting in a short lifespan.
