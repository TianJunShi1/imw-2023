    <h1>Reading 2</h1>
    <p>1. The thesis behind this article revolves around the question "What does it mean to natively design for
      screens?"Screens are the interface between humans and digital information, and the author uses his own purchase of
      aspirin as an example of how he found that the pill The author uses his own purchase of aspirin as an example and
      finds that only a small portion of the pill is aspirin, while most of the rest is a filler substance that helps
      the user use and take it. Computers and screens become equally so as they become smarter and smarter over time.
      And software is the filler.
      Overall, designers need to fully understand the characteristics of the screen as a medium for digital information
      transfer and then use these to design differently.</p>
    <p>2. I prefer skeuo's design concept to flattening. Flattening design is characterized by simplicity, minimalism,
      and the absence of three-dimensional elements. And the disadvantage that comes with such a feature is that it is
      very difficult to recognize the characteristics of this kind of software. For example, more and more software
      nowadays use flat design. When this kind of flat design software floods my phone or computer, it is easy for me
      not to find the exact software I want to find. But if it's a skeuo design, it's easy to find, because it follows
      the objects in our display. For example, I can easily find the trash can in my computer.</p>
    <p>3. The Zoopraxiscope was an early device for displaying motion pictures.
      It was a disk invented by Eadweard Muybridge. As the disk rotated, the image appeared to move, creating the
      illusion of motion.
      It was essentially one of the earliest forms of animation technology. This disc is considered an important
      precursor to theÂ motion picture projectorLinks to an external site..
      In the article, the authors associate the Zoopraxiscope with the Web because the Web is also constantly changing.
      There are a lot of gifs and CSS animations in web design these days.</p>
