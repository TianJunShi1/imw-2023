        <h1>Other</h1>
        <p>During this semester, I have learned a lot about creating websites through this course. I have
            gained a greater and deeper understanding of the Internet and websites. At the beginning of this
            class, I had almost no understanding of website creation and these codes. But as I progressed
            with each lesson, I am now able to create the website I envisioned completely by myself, which
            gives me a great sense of accomplishment. I was also helped a lot by the readings in the course,
            which helped me to understand the story behind the internet and deeper knowledge.</p>
