    <h1>Reading 1</h1>
    <h3>1. what is the thesis of this essay?</h3>
    <p>JR Carpenter's article A Handmade Web defines what a handmade website is, telling of its specificity and
      importance. A handmade website is one that is programmed from scratch by an individual, a web page that is
      coded
      by hand rather than by software; a web page that is created and maintained by an individual rather than by a
      business or a company, and is considered by JR Carpenter to be unique and completely different from the
      corporate,
      commercial, and standardized ones. At the same time, JR Carpenter invokes the term "handmade web" to advocate
      for
      continued active participation in the production of web pages and web policies.</p>
    <h3>2. Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?</h3>

      JR
      Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance to corporate, commercialized, and standardized
      websites, and to exclusive applications that JR Carpenter sees as lacking in individuality, innovation, and
      uniqueness. JR Carpenter's resistance is to promote and obtain a more diverse and personalized web
      environment.</p>
    <h3>3. Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention to the "physicality" of the
      web?</h3>
    <p>Nowadays there are many museums and exhibitions with virtual tours, where you can walk into a museum or an
      exhibition and see the artworks in front of a screen, which I think is a good example. Such exhibitions are
      different from the real ones and may have more fun in them.</p>
